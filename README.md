# TechnoNet

TechnoNet is a project to evaluate the ability of ML models to detect Dyson Swarms from light curve data.  There are two ML models: A Temporal Autoencoder and a Temporal Convolutional Network. To gather Dyson Swarm Light curve data, a novel simulation algorithm is implemented using the REBOUND N-body integrator from Hanno Rein and a Monte Carlo ray-tracing algorithm from Bhowmick & Khaire, 2024.
